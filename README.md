### What I learned

In completing this project, I gained valuable experience with Tailwind CSS and honed my skills in managing responsive layouts across various screen sizes. One particular challenge I tackled was efficiently displaying testimonials and updating the progress bar based on user interaction. Through this, I deepened my understanding of event handling and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
